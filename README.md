# Kup's personal dotfiles

For this project I'm using [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

## Getting started

To restore the configs managed by stow, you need to:
1. jump to the home directory
   ```bash
   $ cd
   ```
2. restore the config via stow:
   ```bash
   $ stow alacritty espanso nvim zellij
   ```
3. profit $$$
